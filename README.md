  --pretty                           store remote schema as pretty JSON for scm tracking and comparison
  -c, --config [configPath]          Load configuration from a file (resolved relative to cwd, or absolute)
  -m, --mock                         Start server in mock mode
  -n, --nock                         Start server in nock mode (Load recorded nocks)
  -r, --record                       Record external requests with nock (use with --nock)
  --nockPath [nockPath]              Where external request records should go
  --graphQLPath [graphQLPath]        Server path at which the API will be mounted (default: /api/graphql)
  --graphQLSubscriptionsPath [path]  Server path at which the API will be mounted (default: /api/graphql)
  --keepAlive [keepAlive]            Subscription connection keep alive intervall
  -s, --use-subfolders               Treat each folder in a datasourcePath as a datasource
  --introspection                    Force activate introspection query on Apollo Server
  -d, --debug                        Run Apollo Server in debug mode
  -h, --help                         output usage information
```


# Mocks
Each `datasource` can expose its own `mocks` and in `--mock` mode will will be added as [mock functions](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/mocking.html) to the schema.
```
node index -s ./datasources --mock
```

## Nocks
A special case for mocking are remote datasources or external requests to third parties, when mainly using red-gql as an aggregation/transformation layer. External requests from datasources can be recorded on a _per query_ basis. The recorded requests can then be automatically replayed in `--nock` mode for the queries or be used to create manual mocks for `--mock` mode.

To record external requests for automatic replay use:
```
node index -s ./datasources --nock --record
```
All requests will be recorded to `path.join(process.cwd(), '/__query_nocks__')` by default.

To start the server in replay mode use:
```
node index -s ./datasources --nock
```
Replaying is currently only possible in production mode, as it needs an existing remote schema for remote datasources.


# Configuration
Create a `.env` file and/or provide the following environment configurations:
- PORT = INT
- NODE_ENV = STRING (development|production)
- LOG_LEVEL = STRING (debug|warn|error|info)
- GQL_API_PATH = STRING (default: '/api/graphql')
- GQL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_PATH = STRING (default: '/ws/subscriptions')
- GQL_SUBSCRIPTION_KEEPALIVE = INT (ms, default: 15000)
- GQL_TRACING = BOOLEAN
- GQL_CACHE_CONTROL_MAX_AGE = INT (seconds)
- APOLLO_ENGINE_API_KEY = [See Apollo Engine Docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/engine/)

To use the CLI in a development environment with a `.env` file, use `node index -r dotenv/config ...`.


# Development Setup
Run `yarn install`.

# Testing
Tests are mainly written as integration tests and should mainly be written as integration tests.

Run `yarn test`.

The test setup mocks all external requests (including remote gql resources like lean), with [nock](https://github.com/nock/nock).
Currently the nocking setup is included with jest at `./framework.js`, this may be subject to change.

### Recording HTTP Mocks for Tests
A test that should use mocks, can be marked by using `it.nock(...)` or `beforeAll.nock(...)`,
just like `it.skip(...)`. `skip` and `only` still works by using `it.only.nock(...)`.

If mocks are found for a test, they'll be replayed automatically. Currently you can [turn off all mocks](https://github.com/nock/nock#turning-nock-off-experimental) by setting the environment variable `NOCK_OFF=true`. Then all tests will run against live APIs.

To record http interaction for a test to later replay it without actually hitting a live API,
run the tests with `JEST_NOCK_RECORD=true`. It will record and save the remote responses in a folder called `__nocks__` next to the test file, from where they are automatically replayed.
