Inspired by [GrAMPS Datsources](https://gramps.js.org/data-source/data-source-overview/), built with [GraphQL Tools](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tools) and [Apollo Server](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server), this is an integrated CLI Tool to work with _GraphQL Modules_. Modules are encapsulated subsets of a larger GraphQL schema and can be [stitched](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/schema-stitching.html) together as a combined GraphQL endpoint.

Themis can be used to support a standalone module, to combine multiple modules (local/remote), or as a gateway with remote modules only.

## Good To Know
As prerequisites, you should be familiar with, or at least have heard of the following technologies:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/)

## Goals
- Reduce the boilerplate of setting up a graphql server
- Make it easy to split a large graph into subsets that can be freely combined
- Cover advanced and complex use cases out of the box
- Sane defaults
