## Download
Install the package via `yarn` or `npm` from the company registry at `https://spring.jfrog.io/spring/api/npm/npm-local-red/`. If you do not have access to the registry yet, contact a maintainer.

```bash
yarn add themis-graphql
```

Then use the CLI in your package.json scripts, or call it directly as `./node_modules/.bin/themis`.

## Use with existing Express Application
